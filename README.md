<h1>About</h1>
Just a very basic web app for displaying content pulled from a json file.

<h3>Adding more content</h3>:
Edit the stream.json file and add in the following:
- Title
- Description
- Iframe (this can be a link to any iframe you want to appear, for this demo I'm using ones built with <a href="https://scribehow.com/" target="_blank">Scribe</a>).
